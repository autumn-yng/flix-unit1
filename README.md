### Notes
My biggest confusion was when I tried to move the files from my original directory to the github local repository. When I moved the entire folders - the grandparents folders that contain everything of this Flix project inside - in my Desktop Github, I wasn't able to commit to main because it said that there was nothing inside those folders. However, when I returned to Finder to check, there were definitely files in the folders. I repeated the process many times so I'm pretty sure there's no mistake like moving the wrong folder. So what I had to do was moving the files and smaller folders inside those grandparent folders, and apparently I was able to commit to main and push, but I'm still not sure if there's anything missing. I hope CodePath tech fellows can inform me of any solutions to this problem or way to check if the stuff pushed to Github is actually working. Thank you very much in advance!
